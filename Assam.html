                <p>Cascading down furiously between the rubber and coffee plantations of Jorhat, the Kakochang Waterfalls are a magnificent wonder of nature. The main waterfall is located 13 km from the Bokakhat in Jorhat and attracts tourists in great numbers year-round. Apart from providing a refreshing retreat and a great subject for shutterbugs, this waterfall gives splendid views of the ruins of Numaligarh and lush green tea plantations. Located close to the Kaziranga National Park.

                <img src="/IMGS/Assam/Majuli.jpg" alt="img">
                <p>Majuli’s eye-warming naturescapes make it one of the top tourist places in Assam. It is the world’s largest riverine island as well as one of the most important Satras established by Sankardeva and Madhavdev. The Majuli islands are spread over an area of around 452 sq km and most of these get submerged underwater during the monsoons, leaving the bigger islands like Kamalabari, Auniati, and Garamur on the surface. This is why it’s best to visit this place in Guwahati in May. This is undoubtedly among the best places to visit in Assam. </p>
